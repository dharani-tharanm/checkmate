# 1. Introduction to Jenkins Pipelines

## Overview
Jenkins is one of the most popular automation servers, widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. A Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that support the implementation and integration of a continuous delivery pipeline. It automates tasks such as building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring a streamlined CI/CD process.

Jenkins pipelines are defined using a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) called a `Jenkinsfile`, which outlines the steps for your entire pipeline.

## Why CI/CD with Jenkins?
- **Automation:** Jenkins pipelines automate the repetitive tasks of building and deploying code.
- **Consistency:** Automation ensures every step in the process is followed consistently, reducing human error.
- **Efficiency:** By running builds, tests, and deployments automatically, Jenkins reduces the time to ship changes to production.
- **Integration:** Jenkins integrates with many tools and services like GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, JFrog, and more.

## Jenkinsfile Basics
A `Jenkinsfile` defines your pipeline and is usually stored at the root of your source code repository. It consists of the following major components:

- **pipeline:** The main structure.
- **agent:** Defines where the pipeline will run (e.g., any node or a specific machine).
- **stages:** The steps or phases of your pipeline, like "Build", "Test", "Deploy".
- **steps:** Individual actions inside stages like checking out the code, running tests, etc.

## Example (Basic Jenkinsfile):
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
            }
        }
    }
}
